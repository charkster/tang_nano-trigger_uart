# tang_nano_9k-trigger_uart
This is a re-write of my previous trigger project. This time Tang Nano and Tang Nano 9k are the target hardware boards and the USB UART is used to configure and enable triggering.
I included my pattern generator and block ram designs, which aid in validating the trigger functions. If you have an inexpensive logic analyzer you can view all the stimulus waveforms and the resulting triggers.
